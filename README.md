</h2>
<p>
The book <i>The Lazy Fundamental Analyst</i> by Fred Piard, 2014, proposes an investment strategy that utilizes fundamental factors
like Price Earnings (PE) and Return on Assets (ROA) to select stocks within an S&P 500 sector. This is combined with a market timing
signal based on S&P 500 earnings per share momentum and unemployment momentum to hedge the investment portfolio. This notebook
explores the hedging stratagy outlined in Fred Piard's <i>The Lazy Fundamental Analyst</i>  The fundamental factor strategy is not explored
in this notebook because of the time and effort this would require.
